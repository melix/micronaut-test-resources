By default, a server will be spawned for each build, and shutdown at the end of a build (or after several builds if using the continuous mode in Gradle).

However, what if you have several projects and that you want to share test resources between them?
As an example, you might have a project which consists of a Kafka publisher and another project with a Kafka consumer.
If they don't use the _same_ Kafka server, then they won't be able to communicate with each other.

The solution to this problem is to use a _shared server_.
By default builds would spawn a server per build on a different port, but if you specify a port explicitly, then both builds will use the same server.

WARNING: If you use a shared server, then you must make sure that the _first build_ to start the server provides all the support modules.
