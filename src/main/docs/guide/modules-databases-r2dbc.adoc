In addition to traditional JDBC support, Micronaut Test Resources also supports R2DBC databases.

The following properties will automatically be set when using a JDBC database:

- `r2dbc.datasources.*.url`
- `r2dbc.datasources.*.username`
- `r2dbc.datasources.*.password`

In order for the database to be properly detected, _one of_ the following properties has to be set:

- `r2dbc.datasources.*.db-type`: the kind of database (preferred, one of `mariadb`, `mysql`, `oracle`, `postgresql`)
- `r2dbc.datasources.*.driverClassName`: the class name of the driver (fallback)
- `r2dbc.datasources.*.dialect`: the dialect to use for the database (fallback)

In addition, R2DBC databases can be configured simply by reading the traditional JDBC properties:

- `datasources.*.db-type`: the kind of database (preferred, one of `mariadb`, `mysql`, `oracle`, `postgresql`)
- `datasources.*.driverClassName`: the class name of the driver (fallback)
- `datasources.*.dialect`: the dialect to use for the database (fallback)

In which case, the name of the datasource must match the name of the R2DBC datasource.
This can be useful when using modules like Flyway which only support JDBC for updating schemas, but still have your application use R2DBC: in this case the container which will be used for R2DBC and JDBC will be the same.
