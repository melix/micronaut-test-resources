Vault support will automatically start a https://www.vaultproject.io/[Hashicorp Vault container] and provide the value of `vault.client.uri` property.

- The default image can be overwritten by setting the `test-resources.containers.vault.image-name` property.
- The default Vault access token is `vault-token` but this can be overridden by setting the `test-resources.containers.vault.token` property.
- Secrets can be inserted into Vault at startup by adding the config:

[source, yaml]
----
test-resources:
  containers:
    vault:
      path: 'secret/my-path'
      secrets:
        - "key1=value1"
        - "key2=value2"
