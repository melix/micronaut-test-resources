MongoDB support will automatically start a https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB container] and provide the value of the `mongodb.uri` property.

The default image can be overwritten by setting the `test-resources.containers.mongodb.image-name` property.

The default database name can be overwritten by setting the `test-resources.containers.mongodb.db-name` property.

Alternatively, if you have multiple MongoDB servers declared in your configuration, the test resources service will supply a different replica set for each database.

For example, if you have `mongodb.servers.users` and `mongodb.servers.books` defined, then the test resources service will supply the `mongodb.servers.users.uri` and `mondodb.servers.books.uri` properties.

Note that in this case, a _single_ server is used, the value of `test-resources.containers.mongodb.db-name` is ignored, and the database name is set to the name of the database you declared (in this example, this would be respectively `users` and `books`).
