The Micronaut Test Resources server is a service which is responsible for handling the lifecycle of test resources.

For example, a MySQL database may need to be started when the tests start, and shutdown at the end of the build.

For this purpose, the test resource server must be started before the application under test starts, and shutdown after test resources are no longer needed.

It means, for example, that with https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:continuous_build[Gradle continuous builds], the test resources server would outlive a single build, making it possible to develop your application while not paying the price of starting a container on each build.
