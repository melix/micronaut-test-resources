The test resources service runs as a separate service, on its own process.

Debugging the test resources service is currently only supported via the Gradle plugin.
This can be configured using the following code:

[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
----
tasks.named("internalStartTestResourcesService") {
    debugServer = true
}
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
----
tasks.internalStartTestResourcesService {
    debugServer.set(true)
}
----

Alternatively, you may want to add the test resources control panel.
