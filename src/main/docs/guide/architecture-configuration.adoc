=== Docker Client creation timeout

The test-resources server communicates with Docker via a docker client.
By default, creation of this client is expected to take less than 10 seconds.
However, under certain circumstances (limited resources, docker in docker, etc.), this may take longer.
To configure the timeout, you can pass a system property `docker.check.timeout.seconds` or an environment variable `TEST_RESOURCES_DOCKER_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` with the number of seconds you require.
